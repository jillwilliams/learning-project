                    <p id="about-us">My name is Sarah Cullen and I was diagnosed with Narcolepsy in 2015 after falling asleep while driving three times. I was also experiencing my head dropping for no reason, and I would wake up at work and not remember falling asleep. After seeing a Neurologist, I was finally diagnosed with Narcolepsy with Cataplexy, three years after the symptoms started to show up.</p>

                <p id="post">Narcolepsy doesn't have to be the end of your life. But I won't lie, it definately will change your life. It is up to you to determine if it will change for the better, or for the worse. Whatever your new life is, you still have a choice to move forward in a positive manner in life.</p>

                <p id="post">Narcolepsy often traps you in the moment, and past or future doesn't really exist in your thoughts. This results in missing appointments or meetings, or what you were suppossed to do that day. It is out of our control, which means it will pick days and make you "stuck in the moment" for most of the day, even if you had something really important to do. Most likely is you may miss that event. The result is the visible issue: how do I deal with missing the appointment or meeting? It is tough to keep a job when you miss meetings, even though you didn't mean to.</p>
